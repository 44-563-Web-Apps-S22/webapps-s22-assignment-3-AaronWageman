    <body>
        <p>I grew up in Lee's Summit, MO. Lee's Summit is just outside of Kansas City. 
            Because of this I grew up as a KC Chiefs fan. 
            I also enjoy doing fantasy football in during the NFL season. 
            Occasionally, I will go trapshooting. One time I shot a perfect 25/25.

        <h2>My Favorite Movie is: The Departed</h2>
        <p>I enjoy the movie because of its plot and the twists at the end of the movie</p>
